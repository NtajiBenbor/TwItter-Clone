## 1. Project Overview :smile:
This project is my attempt to create a Twitter clone using only HTML and CSS. This undertaking turned out to be more successful than I anticipated. I was able to make it responsive, meaning that the app would resize and adjust its layout based on the user's browser window size. While developing this project, I gained a deeper understanding of web page layout and positioning techniques.

## 3. Why I built this :hammer:
This project was one of three that I developed to assess my comprehension of CSS and HTML before advancing to JavaScript. These projects allowed me to apply my understanding of these fundamental web development languages and gain hands-on experience in creating responsive web pages.


## 4. what I learned building this project.
- Creating the layout proved to be the most challenging aspect of this project. It taught me about the trade-offs between employing sticky and fixed position values on an element. The decision to use one or the other can ultimately make or break your layout. 

- **Tackling responsiveness with media queries:** Mastering responsiveness through media queries, I gained proficiency in utilizing media queries and the display property to craft webpages that dynamically adjust based on the user's browser window size..
